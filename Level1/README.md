# Level 1: Building an AI-Powered Chat Interface (PS 1.1)

## Task Overview

In this task, you will develop a simple chat interface that allows users to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) in real-time. This will demonstrate your ability to integrate AI-driven conversational capabilities into a user-friendly interface.

## Objective

- Create an interactive chat interface powered by an LLM.
- Ensure seamless communication between the user and the AI.
- Document the setup and usage process for replication.

## Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**

   - Fork the [BotForge Repository](https://github.com/MU-Enigma/BotForge) to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local environment.

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/BotForge.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**

   - Move into the Level 1 directory to work on your task:

     ```bash
     cd BotForge/Level1/
     ```

4. **Create a Folder with Your Username**

   - Inside the `Level1` directory, create a new folder named after your GitHub username:

     ```bash
     mkdir <your_username>
     ```

5. **Develop the Chat Interface**

   - **Set Up the Environment**:
     - Choose a platform (e.g., Google Colab, local machine) and set up the necessary environment for running the chat interface.
   
   - **Implement the Interface**:
     - Develop the chat interface using your preferred technology stack (e.g., React.js, HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
     - Integrate the LLM API to handle user inputs and generate AI responses.
   
   - **Test the Interface**:
     - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the chat interface functions smoothly and handles basic interactions effectively.

6. **Document the Process**

   - In a `README.md` file, provide detailed instructions on how to set up and run the chat interface. Include:
     - **Installation Steps**: Dependencies and how to install them.
     - **Running the Interface**: Commands and procedures to launch the chat interface.
     - **Usage Guide**: How to interact with the chat interface.
     - **Screenshots**: Visual representations of the interface and sample conversations.

7. **Add the Documentation and Related Files**

   - Place all relevant files, including the `README.md`, code files, and screenshots, in your username's folder:

     ```bash
     cp <your_files> <your_username>/
     ```

8. **Add and Commit Your Changes**

   - Stage the changes:

     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

   - Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "Added Level 1: Building an AI-Powered Chat Interface by <your_username>"
     ```

9. **Push Your Changes and Open a Pull Request**

   - Push your changes to your forked repository:

     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

   - Open a Pull Request (PR) on the original **BotForge** repository to submit your work for review.
