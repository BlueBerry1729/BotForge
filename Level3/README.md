## Level 3: Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) (PS 3.1)

### Task Overview

In this advanced task, you will fine-tune a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to perform a specific task, such as generating text in a unique style or solving a particular type of problem. This will demonstrate your ability to customize and enhance AI models for specialized applications.

### Objective

- Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM for a defined task.
- Evaluate and document the performance of the fine-tuned model.
- Provide comprehensive documentation to replicate the fine-tuning process.

### Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**

   - Fork the [BotForge Repository](https://github.com/MU-Enigma/BotForge) to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local environment.

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/BotForge.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**

   - Move into the Level 3 directory to work on your task:

     ```bash
     cd BotForge/Level3/
     ```

4. **Create a Folder with Your Username**

   - Inside the `Level3` directory, create a new folder named after your GitHub username:

     ```bash
     mkdir <your_username>
     ```

5. **Fine-Tune the LLM**

   - **Select a Pre-trained Model**:
     - Choose an appropriate pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-2, BERT) based on your task requirements.
   
   - **Define the Task**:
     - Specify the task for fine-tuning, such as generating text in a specific style, answering domain-specific questions, or enhancing conversational abilities.
   
   - **Prepare the Dataset**:
     - Collect and preprocess the dataset required for fine-tuning the model.
   
   - **Fine-Tune the Model**:
     - Use frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune the model on your dataset.
     - Adjust hyperparameters and monitor the training process to optimize performance.
   
   - **Evaluate the Model**:
     - Test the fine-tuned model to assess its performance on the defined task.
     - Generate example outputs to demonstrate the model's capabilities.

6. **Document the Process**

   - In your username's folder, include the following:
     - **Fine-Tuned Model**: Save the fine-tuned model files.
     - **Example Outputs**: Provide samples of the model's outputs demonstrating its performance.
     - **README.md**: A comprehensive guide detailing:
       - **Dataset**: Description and source of the dataset used.
       - **Fine-Tuning Process**: Steps taken to fine-tune the model, including code snippets.
       - **Hyperparameters**: Configuration details used during training.
       - **Challenges and Solutions**: Any obstacles encountered and how they were addressed.
     - **Optional**: Include code files or scripts used for fine-tuning to help others replicate your work.

7. **Add the Documentation and Related Files**

   - Place all relevant files, including the fine-tuned model, example outputs, and `README.md`, in your username's folder:

     ```bash
     cp <your_files> <your_username>/
     ```

8. **Add and Commit Your Changes**

   - Stage the changes:

     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

   - Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

     ```bash
     git commit -m "Added Level 3: Fine-Tuning an LLM by <your_username>"
     ```

9. **Push Your Changes and Open a Pull Request**

   - Push your changes to your forked repository:

     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

   - Open a Pull Request (PR) on the original **BotForge** repository to submit your work for review.
