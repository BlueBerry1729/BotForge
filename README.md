# BotForge: An Open-Source NLP Solutions Hub

Welcome to **BotForge**, an open-source project dedicated to advancing NLP-based solutions. This repository offers a series of challenges, each tagged with a level and a problem statement (PS) number, to guide contributors through various aspects of natural language processing and AI-driven conversation systems. Whether you're interested in prompt engineering, building interactive chatbots, or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), BotForge provides a platform for developing and sharing innovative solutions.

## Task Levels Overview

### Level 0: Prompt Engineering (PS 0.1)

- **Objective**: Convince an AI to accept a false fact by iteratively refining a well-crafted prompt. This task explores prompt engineering and its impact on AI behavior.

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Create a prompt that introduces a completely fictional fact.
  - Refine the prompt iteratively through interactions with the AI, adjusting it until the AI accepts the false information.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Document each version of the prompt and corresponding AI responses in a step-by-step manner.
  - Provide insights into how and why you changed the prompt in each iteration.
  - Ensure to include all steps so others can replicate the process and observe the same results.
  - Submit all documentation in the `Level0` directory as a `.txt` or `.md` file.

### Level 1: Building an AI-Powered Chat Interface (PS 1.1)

- **Objective**: Create a simple chat interface to interact with an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) in real-time, showcasing basic AI-driven conversation capabilities.

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Implement a chat interface to interact with an open-source LLM.
  - Set up the interface locally or on Google Colab, and test it by having real-time conversations with the model.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the LLM and the chat interface, ensuring it can be replicated by others.
  - Include screenshots of the interface and conversation logs.
  - Submit any `.ipynb` files or code along with detailed instructions on how to run the interface.
  - Add everything to the `Level1` directory with proper documentation.

### Level 2: Developing a Discord Bot (PS 2.1)

- **Objective**: Build and deploy a functional Discord bot with one core feature, such as moderation, entertainment, or utility. This task demonstrates the application of NLP-based systems in communication platforms.

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Develop a Discord bot using your preferred language or framework.
  - Implement a feature like moderation commands, a game, or a utility (e.g., reminders or notifications).
  - Test the bot on a live Discord server.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Share detailed steps to set up the Discord bot, including all configuration files and any necessary APIs or permissions.
  - Include a guide for replicating the deployment process, ensuring that others can launch and test the bot in their own Discord servers.
  - Provide screenshots showing the bot in action, and optionally provide a server invite link where the bot is live.
  - Submit the source code, configuration files, and deployment guide to the `Level2` directory.

### Level 3: Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) (PS 3.1)

- **Objective**: Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to perform a specific task, such as generating text in a custom style or solving a particular type of problem.

- **Problem Statement**:
  - Select a pre-trained LLM and fine-tune it for a specific task (e.g., generating text in a particular tone or style).
  - Gather and preprocess the dataset for fine-tuning.
  - Train the model, adjust hyperparameters, and evaluate its performance.

- **What to Submit**:
  - Submit a step-by-step guide for replicating the fine-tuning process, including dataset preparation, environment setup, and model training.
  - Provide the fine-tuned model and example outputs to demonstrate the results.
  - Include a README file that explains how to run and test the fine-tuned model, making sure others can replicate the training process and generate similar results.
  - Add all materials to the `Level3` directory.
